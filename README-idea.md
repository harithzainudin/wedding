---

### Others

- [ ]  **Mobile Optimization:** Since 90% of guests will open this via WhatsApp on their phones, ensure your **buttons are large** and text is readable without zooming.
- [ ]  **Mobile First:** Check how the fonts look on your phone. Some fonts look great on a laptop but become tiny and unreadable on a small screen.
- [ ]  **Schedule of Events:** If your wedding has multiple parts (Nikah at 9:00 AM, Reception at 12:00 PM, Cake Cutting at 2:00 PM), a small timeline is very helpful for guests.
- [ ]  **Password Protection:** If you want to keep your location or photos private, you can add a simple "Enter Password" screen (the password could be on the physical card or shared in the WhatsApp text).
- [ ]  **Parking Info:** If the venue has limited parking or a specific "Drop-off" point, adding a small note or a mini-map image can save guests a lot of frustration.
- [ ]  Button for English/Malay translation
- [ ]  make sure  **"Add to Calendar"** and **"Waze/Google Maps"** buttons are sticky (stay visible) or located at the very bottom of the page so guests don't have to scroll back up to find the location when they arrive at the venue.
- [ ]  Website theme - Earthy minimalism and Quiet luxury
- [ ]  **Readability is King:** Avoid using "Script" or "Cursive" fonts for the address or time. People need to be able to read those at a glance while driving or in a hurry. Save the fancy fonts for your names only.
- [ ]  **Contrast:** Ensure your text color is dark enough against the background. If you use a photo as a background, add a semi-transparent overlay (black or white) so the text "pops."
- [ ]  **Opacity:** If you find the dividers are too "loud," try setting their opacity to 50% or 70%. This makes them blend more naturally with your background color.
- [ ]  **The "Back" Button:** Ensure that after someone fills out the RSVP, it shows a "Thank You" message so they know it actually went through.
- [ ]  Need Admin/CMS website to control all the information
- [ ]  Maybe in CMS can choose which theme to change accordingly

## 🎁 New Feature: The "Gift Registry" (Gift Booking)

To solve the issue of redundant gifts, you can add a **Gift Contribution/Claim** section. Here is how it should work:

- **The List:** You list specific items you need (e.g., Toaster, Air Fryer, Vacuum).
- **The "Claim" Mechanic:** When a guest clicks "I'll get this," the item is marked as **"Reserved"** or **"Bought"** so no one else can select it.
- **Status Bar:** "3/10 items remaining."
- **Alternative (Money Packet):** If they prefer not to buy an item, provide a "Digital Salam" section with a QR code for your bank (DuitNow).

## Things to Note

### The "Three-Scroll" Rule

Most guests lose interest or get confused if they have to scroll too much. Try to fit everything into three main views:

- **Scroll 1:** The "Wow" (Names, Photo, Countdown).
- **Scroll 2:** The "Where & When" (Map buttons, Calendar link).
- **Scroll 3:** The "Action" (RSVP form & Gift Registry).

## Infra

- Deploy AWS lambda, api gateway, s3 bucket for storage, and use DynamoDB for database. Use [SST.dev](http://SST.dev) to handle this
- Use vuejs and github pages for frontend website
- Since your frontend is on GitHub Pages and your backend is on AWS, you need to watch out for **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**.
    1. **CORS Header:** Ensure your Lambda/API Gateway allows requests from your GitHub Pages URL (e.g., `https://yourname.github.io`).
    2. **Environment Variables:** When you build your Vue app, you’ll need to inject the `API_URL` generated by AWS.
        - *SST Tip:* You can use the `sst build` command to output these URLs directly into a `.env` file for your Vue app.
- **API Gateway:** Use a **Simple HTTP API** (cheaper and faster than REST API for this use case).
- For the "Book an Item" feature you mentioned earlier:
    1. **The Logic:** When a guest selects an item, the Lambda should perform a **TransactWriteItems** in DynamoDB.
    2. **Why:** This ensures that if two people click "Book the Air Fryer" at the exact same second, only one person succeeds, and the other gets a "Sorry, already taken!" message.
